== PostgreSQL client concurrency Benchmarking

What does this benchmark measure ?

Client latencies over a single connection to PostgreSQL using a bunch
clients under various concurrency configuration.

The benchmark uses JMH for execution although it is *not* a micro-benchmark. JMH
is mostly used as an engine for running the benchmark that provides lot of flexibility
and reporting features.

== How to run it

Buld the fat jar

```
> mvn clean package
```

Run it

```
> java -jar target/benchmark.jar
```

The benchmark is executed with an embedded database on localhost running a vanilla
sql statement with both JDBC and the Reactive Postgres Client. This is just for
demonstating the bare usage, results cannot be trusted.

Using an external database, executing a specific statement:

```
java -jar target/jmh-benchmark.jar \
   -p pipelining=1,2,4,16
   -p connectUri=postgres://benchmarkdbuser:benchmarkdbpass@TFB-database:5432/hello_world \
   -p sql="SELECT * from World where id=1"
   -p count=5000
```

- `pipelining` defines the pipeling applied to the connection (only effective for the Reactive PG client
- `connectUri` follows the libpq https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-CONNSTRING[format]
- `sql` is the SQL statement to execute, note it cannot contain a `,` char as this is used as a separator by JMH
- `count` the number of times the prepared statement is executed

Each operation samples the time to execute the total number of times the prepared statement
is executed, in the example above it measures how long it takes to execute `SELECT * from World where id=1`
`5000` times with JDBC and the Reactive PG client with pipelining values `1`, `2`, `4` and `16`.

The pipelining effect varies according to:

- the database latency: increased latencies increase pipelining benefits
- the statement latency: expensive queries don't benefit from latency

== Some results

Those are the results gathered using dedicated hardware, don't trust them instead

- run them on your own hardware
- review the benchmark

This benchmark executed the example above.

.100µs latency

.1ms latency
image::1ms-latency.png[]

WARNING: The two results are not normalized, the 100µs latency executes the 5000 queries
in about 300ms, the 1ms latency executes the 5000 queries in about 13 seconds.
